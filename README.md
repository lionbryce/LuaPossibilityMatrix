Ever wanted to pretend to gamble on a quantum computer by calculating all possible outcomes ahead of time and then picking 1 at random?

This project also contains 2 wrappers, 1 to allow adding strings w/o editing the string metatable and 1 to allow: {a,b}*{c,d} = {ac,b+d}

Not sure why you'd want to use this unless you run it once and cache the results forever

I ran calculated all possible outcomes of flipping a coin 20 times and it used 300MB of RAM
